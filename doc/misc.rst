Installation
============

This command should install :mod:`sumpy`::

    pip install sumpy

You may need to run this with :command:`sudo`.
If you don't already have `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip>`_,
run this beforehand::

    curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py

For a more manual installation, download the source, unpack it,
and say::

    python setup.py install

In addition, you need to have :mod:`numpy` installed.

Symbolic backends
-----------------

:mod:`sumpy` supports two symbolic backends: sympy and SymEngine. To use the
SymEngine backend, ensure that the `SymEngine library
<https://github.com/symengine/symengine>`_ and the `SymEngine Python bindings
<https://github.com/symengine/symengine.py>`_ are installed.

By default, :mod:`sumpy` prefers using SymEngine but falls back to sympy if it
detects that SymEngine is not installed. To force the use of a particular
backend, set the environment variable `SUMPY_FORCE_SYMBOLIC_BACKEND` to
`symengine` or `sympy`.
