    get_pde_in_recurrence_form
    Input: 
        - pde a LinearPDESystemOperator such that assert(len(pde.eqs) == 1) is true.
    Output: 
        - ode_in_r, which is the pde but now as an ode in r, which f(r) satisfies. 
        - var represents the variables for the input
        - n_derivs, the max number of derivatives of f that are floating around.

    Description: We assume we are handed a system of 1 sumpy PDE (pde) and we output the 
    pde in a way that allows us to easily replace derivatives with respect to r. Typo
